        <h1>Sihanoukville</h1>
        <p>'Beach town', 'port community', 'fledgling resort destination' - all describe Sihanoukville, Cambodia's
            premier beach town. Sihanoukville's white sand beaches and warm Gulf of Thailand waters combine with a laid
            back, beachy atmosphere to provide a great little tropical getaway. Sihanoukville is a place to unwind by
            the beach, enjoy the fresh from-the-ocean seafood, take in a snorkeling or scuba trip, and generally
            slow-down, lay back and chill-out.
            Sihanoukville has a different look and feel than most Cambodian towns. Constructed as a port city in the
            late 1950s, the town is much newer, more urban and cosmopolitan than most Cambodian provincial cities.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, Sihanoukville is as much a beach town as it is a port town, catering to beach-going weekenders from
            Phnom Penh as well as a steadily increasing number of foreign visitors. Still, the pace of life in
            Sihanoukville is very relaxed.
            Cows occasionally wander the main road, outside town foreign faces draw smiles and curious stares, and most
            of the beaches offer only beach umbrellas, thatched roofed eateries, and a growing number of restaurants,
            bungalows and hotels.
            Sihanoukville has a more than ample supply of accommodations, including a 5-star resort complex on Sokha
            Beach, several mid-range places downtown and at the beaches, a few 'upscale' three-star hotels, and dozens
            of budget guesthouses, especially on Weather Station Hill (Victory Hill).

            Considering the moderate number of visitors to Sihanoukville, the town offers a surprising number and
            variety of restaurants and bars.
            Fresh seafood, especially crab, prawns and ocean fish, has always been one of the town's biggest draws, but
            there is also a wide variety of places offering foreign cuisines - Australian, French, Indian, German, Sri
            Lankan, British, Italian, pizza places, a couple of western bakeries and even a espresso coffee shop.
            And these days Sihanoukville offers a pretty good night life as well with a wide variety of bars staying
            open well into the wee hours, especially on Weather Station Hill, in the downtown area, and the beach bars
            on Ochheuteal, Serendipity and Victory Beaches.

        <h3>Otres Beach</h3>
        <img id="KT1" src="Sihanoukville_4_Otres.jpeg" alt="Otres" width="100" height="100">
        <p>Otres Beach is the next beach south of Ochheuteal Beach and resembles Ochheuteal in many ways - a three
            kilometer crescent of near white sand facing the southwest. But Otres is far less developed and touristed
            than Ochheuteal, offering a more leisurely, relaxed atmosphere, and caught the eye of Forbes this year,
            listed amongst the Top 22 Beaches in Asia. Though much of the beach was recently closed for a development
            project, more than a kilometer remains open and retains the same laid back feel. There are no hotels, spas
            or large restaurants on Otres, just a string of beach-shack bars, restaurants and bungalows stretching along
            the sand from the intersection to the new development project.

            Most all of the beach restaurants serve seafood and more, but each place has its own unique flavor. There
            are several bungalows and small guesthouses on the beach, most sitting right on the sand just a few meters
            from the water. Price and quality of the rooms and bungalows varies, so shop around for the room that best
            suits your budget and requirements. Bear in mind that the seclusion and lack of development that affords
            Otres its tranquil atmosphere also limits some services. After dark it can be difficult to travel between
            Otres and town.
            To get to Otres: 1) The road from Ochheuteal over the hill through Queen Hill Resort allows easy motorcycle
            access but is blocked to cars and tuk-tuks. 2) By car or tuk-tuk from Ochheuteal: follow Polaway Street (1
            Kanda Street) to the end of the pavement and turn left, cross the bridge and proceed about 500m to the next
            right turn. Turn and follow the road about 2.3km to the beach. Rough road. 3) Omui Street from downtown is
            paved and in good condition. Follow to the Otres turnoff and turn left.</p>
        <h3>Sokha Beach</h3>

        <h3>Orchheuteal Beach</h3>
        <img id="KT2" src="Sihanoukville_2_Orchheuteal.jpg" alt="Orchheuteal" width="100" height="100">
        <p>Ochheuteal Beach, known as UNTAC Beach in the early 1990s and it is now the most popular in Sihanoukville,
            offering the full spectrum of beach venues from upscale hotels and dining to laid-back budget beach bars and
            bungalows. Ochheuteal is long, sandy and narrow, with 'Serendipity Beach' at the northern end, a
            golf-course development at the southern end, and a cluster of mid-range hotels and restaurants near the MP
            base in the middle. Grass umbrellas, rentable beach chairs and little drink huts line the beach from one end
            to the other. It offers several nice hotels including the Seaside and Crystal, the mid-range Holiday, as
            well as some of Sihanoukville's better seafood restaurants, (Sea Dragon, Susaday, Sunshine and Les
            Feuilles), within walking distance of the hotels. Further south along the beach in front of the golf course
            develop-ment, a number of budget traveler/backpacker oriented bar/restaurant/beach hangouts have sprung up
            offering chairs, umbrellas, drinks and a chill-out atmosphere. At Ochheuteal's extreme northern end,
            Serendipity Beach' is the only beach in Sihanouk-ville to offer bungalows and guesthouse rooms right on the
            sand. Over the past two years Serendipity's popularity has grown exponentially, as have the number of
            bungalows, hotels, and restaurants. The beach now offers several mid-range and budget places including
            Coasters' well-known bungalows, Uncle Bob's 24-hour restaurant and budget rooms, and The Beach?s mid-range
            rooms. There are also places popping up on the hill just above the Serendipity such as Diamond Guesthouse
            and closer to the traffic circle, Sanctuary Bar and Guesthouse. To get to Serendipity Beach follow Ekareach
            Street straight through the Golden Lion Traffic Circle and UP and over the hill.</p>
