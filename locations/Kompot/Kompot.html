            <p>Locates at 42Km distance from the provincial town of Kampot, and was found by a French people 1922 during
                the reign of the King, Sisovath Before, Bokor was a leisure place for French colonists who need to
                exchange atmosphere from the plain area to the mountain area at seaside. The Mountain of Bokor has
                1,075-meter height, good weather and beautiful natural view with big trees and
                rocks shaping up as animal figure. In Sang Kum Reas Ni Yum, there were public buildings, which look like
                a city there. On the other side of the road at Bokor Mountain, you see an enormous monument. The 29
                meters high Lok Yeay Mao Monument is known as a goddess in Buddhist culture and locals still come here
                to pray. Legend says that Lok Yeay Mao was the protector of the mountains and coastal area of Cambodia.
                You can pray to her statue for protection
                along your journey.</p>
            <p>The well known Le Bokor Palace hotel was first opened in 1925 by the French. The hotel that is positioned
                between the clouds of Bokor Hill in Cambodia was abandoned in 1946 during the Indochina war. After
                reopening it in 1962 it took only 10 years till it got abandoned again. This time Pol Pots Khmer Rouge
                forces took over the area and used it as a stronghold. The Khmer Rouge managed to hold the stronghold
                until the early 90s.
                After several years of renovation, the Bokor Palace reopened its doors in 2018 to function as a 6-star
                hotel and casino.
                And around 12pm or so in the afternoon, fog will start to form on the mountain which will make the
                temperature drop and the atmosphere very mysterious and magical.

                circular hole then leads to the sky. According to many visitors, the limestone cave in Kampot is not as
