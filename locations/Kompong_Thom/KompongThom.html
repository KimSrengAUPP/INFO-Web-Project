            <h1>Kompong Thom</h1>
            <p>Kampong Thom is Cambodia's second largest province by area. Its capital is named Kampong
                Thom, a
                picturesque town on the banks of the Stung Saen River.The Sambor temple and Prei Kuk temple are the two
                main temples in Kompong Thom as well as other less significant Angkorian sites. Kompong Thom was a very
                powerful capital in Southeast Asia during the Funan period. Later on, during the French rule, the
                province was home to a large group named the Stieng, but they have long been assimilated into Khmer
                society.Kampong Pos Thom was the original name of the present called Kampong Thom. Because originally
                long time ago, at the dock of the Sen River next to a big natural lake, there was a big cave with a pair
                of big snakes inside. The people living around this area usually saw these big snakes every Buddhist
                Holiday. Time after that, the snakes disappeared, and the people of that area called it Kampong Pos
                Thom. Then, only short words Kampong Thom. During the French colony in Cambodia, the French ruled and
                divided Cambodian territory into provinces, and named them according to the spoken words of the people
                Kampong Thom Province.The provincial capital Kampong Thom is another bustling town on the banks of the
                Stung Sen River. The town itself is strategically located on the National Highway No 6 between Phnom
                Penh and Siem Reap. Its more a stopover to have a break from driving long distances or to eat something
                on the way to Siem Reap or Phnom Penh, than a very touristic place. Despite the town itself people come
                to explore the pre-Angkorian Chenla capital Sambor Prei Kuk, the remote temples of Preah Khan and Prasat
                Preah Vihear.</p>
            <h3>Santuk Mountain</h3>
            <img id="KT1" src="Kompong_Thom_2_Santuk.jpg" alt="Santuk Mountain" width="100" height="100">
            <p>Phnom Santuk is a large area featuring a monastery with old and new pagoda and a large array of Buddhist
                carvings depicting the Buddha in the many ritual positions. In some ways its almost a Buddhist theme
                park, where people come on the days off work not only to pray but also to relax.

                The bas reliefs are numerous and you can spend an hour wandering around along with taking in the views
                from the top of the mountain from many different points. There are also loads of monkeys who will
                happily rummage through any bags you leave by your bike. So, buy some snacks and a drink and the stall
                owners may watch over your gear for you.</p>
            <p>The Entrance is free although along the way you will probably buy some flowers from kids and drop some
                money in the donation boxes for the shrine. And it is a long way to the shrine. Some even called it the
                thousand step stairway. The ancient heritages on the top of the mountain:
                Many Buddha statues were carved from great mountain rock including three big Buddha statues reaching
                Nirvana, each has more than 10-meter length.
                Prasat Touch of pyramid shape, made of sandstone, has three stories and three-meter height, and is
                located next to the ancient wooden temple (presently, it is made of cement) with a rectangular pond (10m
                x 4m).
                Preah Bat Chann Tuk statue was carved on the stone shaped as food of a sacred human, and there are
                many other small sculptures. By the stories, the construction and the statues were erected during the
                reign of Preah Ponhea Dharma Reacha (1474-1494) and have been maintained until now.</p>
            <h3>Prei Kuk Temple</h3>
            <img id="KT2" src="Kompong_Thom_3.jpg" alt="Prei Kuk" width="100" height="100">
            <p>The archaeological site of Sambor Prei Kuk, “the temple in the richness of the forest” in the Khmer
                language, has been identified as Ishanapura, the capital of the Chenla Empire that flourished in the
                late 6th and early 7th centuries AD. The property comprises more than a hundred temples, ten of which
                are octagonal, unique specimens of their genre in South-East Asia. Decorated sandstone elements in the
                site are characteristic of the pre-Angkor decorative idiom, known as the Sambor Prei Kuk Style. Some of
                these elements, including lintels, pediments and colonnades, are true masterpieces. The art and
                architecture developed here became models for other parts of the region and lay the ground for the
                unique Khmer style of the Angkor period.</p>
            <p>There are about 100 or more temples in Sambor Prei Kuk Temple Zone, each filled with details reflecting
                the technical and spiritual ideas about the ideas, culture and people of that time.</p>
