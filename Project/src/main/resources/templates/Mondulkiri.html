        <h2 class="location-title">Mondulkiri</h2>
        <p>Mondulkiri is an eastern province of Cambodia, which is the most sparsely populated province in the whole
            country although being the largest province in Cambodia. The province is chock full of natural beauty,
            with thickly forested mountains, powerful waterfalls and the lush green rolling hills of the western
            side.
            <br><br>
            Despite the growing deforestation, especially due to the valuable minerals remaining in the deep
            red, fertile ground, Mondulkiri has still one of the biggest successional woodlands of Cambodia. Except
            being in Sen Monorom, you'll find deep pure jungle, with a huge variety of flora and fauna. You may also
            find gigantic and beautiful waterfalls, where you can take an empowering shower, such as the impressive
            Bou Sraa.
            <br><br>
            Sen Monorom is the provincial capital and doesn't show up as a typical Cambodian town, while
            it is the only town the province has to speak of. With approx. 7500 inhabitants, 20 guesthouses, 12
            restaurants, 3 bars and no post office it is often compared to American Wild West frontier towns.
            Concerning the quietness and beauty of Sen Monorom people from other parts of the country move here and
            therefore the land price doubled from 2006 to 2007.
            <br><br>
            The town of Sen Monorom is the best base camp for
            travellers who want to explore the surrounding areas. A quiet but beautiful town nestled into the hills;
            it has a lot of potential to develop into a centre for non-intrusive eco-tourism. At present, it's very
            undeveloped, which gives you a feeling of going somewhere off the beaten tourist trail. Add to that the
            communities of hill tribe people, who are not affected by mass-tourism, as they are in neighbouring
            Thailand, and you have an area that is very attractive to the adventure traveller.
            <br><br>
            Also interesting is
            the variety of languages being used: Khmer, hill tribe languages, Vietnamese and Lao. 80 percent of the
            population in Mondulkiri is made up of ten tribal minorities, with the majority of them being the
            Chunchiet from the tribe of the Phnong. The remaining 20 percent are Khmer, Chinese and Muslim Cham.
            Most of the population lives off the land, planting rice, fruit trees and a variety of vegetables.
            Others grow, coffee, strawberries, rubber and cashew nuts.
            <br><br>
            More and more houses are built in the
            typical Khmer style. Visiting the hill tribes you still can find the traditional Phnong houses. In the
            houses you can find traditional gongs and big jars, whereby the last ones are said to be more than a
            thousand years old. There are various sorts of gongs used for different occasions. Jars and gongs are
            among the most valuable possessions in an indigenous community, whether in traditional, spiritual or
            material terms. During the Khmer Rouge Regime those objects were buried in hidden places in the jungle
            and in many cases they still wait in the ground.
            <br><br>

            Locates at Pich Chinda District in 43 kilometer distance from the provincial town by red soil road. The
            double-drop waterfall is very popular with the locals who use it as a bathing and picnic spot. Its top
            level is around 10m in height, and the lower level drops down 25m to the gorge. It is in a scenic and
            pristine setting and offers great photo ops. Nearby is the ethnic Phnong village called Pichinda which
            has a small guesthouse. Some snacks are available at the falls, but bring food if you would like
            something more substantial. Then we head northeast to Bou Sra. We never rode north on this road before
            and I am surprised that right behind the first hill it is getting rougher than most we have seen
            yesterday. We cross a small river on an improvised bridge and are charged 500 Riel each by a bunch of
            kids.
            <br><br>
            Boosra is the most beautiful waterfall in Modulkiri and shared into three stages:

            First stage: The waterfall has 15-meter diameter and 15-meter to 20-meter height in rainy season, and
            20-meter diameter and 18-meter to 25-meter height in dry season. The second stage of waterfall has
            150-meter distance from the first stage.
            Second stage: The waterfall has 23-meter diameter and 15-meter to 20-meter height in rainy season, and
            20-meter diameter and 18-meter to 25-meter height in dry season. The second stage of waterfall has
            150-meter distance from the first stage.
            Third stage: The waterfall has stronger speed than the second stage. This stage can not be reached
            because it locates in the thick forest, lacks of transporting mean and is dangerous due to having
            fierce-wild animals.
