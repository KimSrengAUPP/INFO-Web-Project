        <p> Cambodia's second largest city lies in the heart of the Northwest and until the war years was the leading
            rice-producing province of the country. Battambang did not give way to the Khmer Rouge movement until after
            the fall of Phnom Penh, but it's been in the center of the ongoing government Khmer Rouge conflict ever
            since the Vietnamese invasion in 1979 pushed the genocidal regime out of Phnom Penh and to the Northwest.
            Until the surrender deal of Ieng Sary (Khmer Rouge number three man based in Pailin), Battambang was the
            Khmer Rouge in the region. Earlier history saw Battambang flip-flopping back and forth between Thailand
            (called Siam before their 20th-century renaming) and Cambodia.

            Battambang is the main hub of the Northwest connecting the entire region with Phnom Penh and Thailand, and
            as such it's a vital link for Cambodia. Battambang city is a peaceful and pleasant place these days.
            The main parts of the city are situated closed to the Sangker River, a tranquil, small body of water that
            winds its way through Battambang Province. It is a nice, picturesque setting. As with much of Cambodia, the
            French architecture is an attractive bonus of the city.
            <br><br>
            Barset Temple was built during the reign of King, Soriyak Varman I (1002-1050) and located on a hill at Ba
            Set village, Ta Pun commune in 15 kilometer distance from the provincial town. Ba Set temple adapts the
            architecture of 11th century and built in 1036 and 1042. Next to the temple, there is a pond having 20 meter
            length 12 meter width and 10 meter depth. The pond is never dried, though in the dry season. In rainy
            season, the water level is higher than usual. Phnom Sam Pov Resort is the natural resort located along the
            National Road No 57 (the former National Road No10) at Sam Puoy commune (the high land having more than 100
            meter height) in 12 kilometer distance from the provincial town of Battambang. On the top of Sam Puoy
            mountain, there are temple and three natural wells, namely Pkar Slar, Lo Khuon and Ak So Pheak. Next to Sam
            Puoy mountain, there are some main mountains, the natural site like Phnom Trung Moan, Phnom Trung Tea and
            Phnom Neang Rum Say Sork. These mountains related to the Cambodia folk legend of Reach Kol Neang Rum Say
            Sork.
            <br><br>
            Sek Sak Resort is the natural resort, which has been popular since before the civil war time. Sek Sak
            stretches along the river bank full of plant, trees and bamboo-green nature in 500 meter length. As long as
            visiting Sek Sak, tourists can also visit other attractive sites like Po Pus Pich Chen Da Dong Tong and Sa
            Ang speak, the pre-history site in five kilometer to six kilometer distance from each other. Sek Sak located
            Treng commune, Rotanak Mondul District in 50 kilometer distance from the provincial town of Battambang along
            the National Road No 57, the former National Road No 10.
