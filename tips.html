            <h2>Tips for travelling around Cambodia</h2>
            <h3>#1. Cambodia is Awesome and There is A Lot to See and Do</h3>
            <p>Cambodia's a pretty awesome country to visit. In many ways it's like Thailand was 20 years ago - tourism
                is growing rapidly, as is the country, yet it still retains that old skool southeast Asian charm,
                beautiful landscapes, friendly locals, and wonderful food.
                If you have time, we recommend visiting Phnom Penh, Siem Reap and Angkor Wat, the Islands, Chi Phat
                community based eco-tourism project, Battambang and Kampot.
            </p>
            <h3>#2. Cambodian Speak Other Languages</h3>
            <p>Khmer is the only official Cambodian language.

                But this is not a language that youll just pick up after spending a few weeks in the country. Of course,
                we'd encourage you to learn how to say 'hello' (Chom Reap Sour), 'goodbye' (Chom Reap Lear), 'thank you'
                (Arkun) and maybe some numbers, but nobody expects you to come back fluent. Its spider-leg alphabet is
                also going to be totally illegible.

                The good news is that because Cambodia has been exposed to tourists for many, many years, lots of
                younger people - and those in touristic locations or working in the hospitality industry - will speak
                English in varying degrees.</p>
            <h3>#3. Angkor Wat Deserves A Personal Visit</h3>
            <p>The jewel in the crown, the vast complex of temples both immaculately preserved and beautifully decaying
                is certainly worth its fame. However, the actual way you experience it is down to your personal
                preferences.

                It's a very early start (about 4 am) and departure from the town of Siem Reap to witness the famous yet
                crowded sunrise, but beyond that how you choose to explore the site is down to time, your budget, and
                the simple fact that temple fatigue is not uncommon. For those of you who wish to devour both the
                well-known and the lesser visited in all their glorious detail, opt to spread your time over two or
                three days.</p>
            <h3>#4. Use Tuk-Tuks or Buses to Get Around</h3>
            <p>The easiest way to explore cities/towns in Cambodia is via tuk-tuk. They're generally inexpensive,
                especially when compared to taxi's, and are nimble enough to get you from A - B before you know it.
                If you're travelling regionally, be sure to use the bus network. It's widespread, with many operators
                available on the main routes, such as Phnom Penh - Sihanoukville.</p>
            <h3>#5. Scooter Snatches Are Real</h3>
            <p>Safety during travels is very important. We know that not everybody is out to get us, don't have our money
                perpetually stored in secret wallets hidden in our underwear, nor do we avoid busy streets in busy
                cities for fear of getting robbed.
                We are, however, experienced travellers with a decent track record of not having bad experiences happen to us on
                the road.
                Bag snatching is a very real problem in Cambodia, specifically in Phnom Penh. This applies to phones and other valuables
                as well. Keep any valuables safe and away from other's arm's reach.</p>
